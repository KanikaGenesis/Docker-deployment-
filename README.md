# Elastic Beanstalk Docker Deployment

This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to deploy a custom Docker container with Nginx using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The project involves creating a custom container image, modifying the Nginx welcome page, and deploying the container to Elastic Beanstalk for cloud hosting.


## Overview

Containers provide an efficient way to package applications with their dependencies. Docker is used in this project to manage and deploy containers. Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the deployment process by abstracting infrastructure setup.


## Key Features
- **Custom Docker Image:** Built using a `Dockerfile`, with a customized Nginx welcome page.
- **Elastic Beanstalk Deployment:** Quick deployment of the Docker container to the cloud.
- **Nginx Server:** Acts as a web server to serve the customized content.
